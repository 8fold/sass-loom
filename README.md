# 8fold Loom

The idea behind Loom is to make creating design systems easier, which may not necessarily make software development easier at first.

The following reflections are meant as personal perspectives and possible gaps or ways to "scratch our own itch" in the CSS design system space.

When describing pains and joys we will reference to example libraries and frameworks that appear to have the quality under examination. This reference is not meant as a positive or negative critique on the implementations as it is our view that if they did not deliver value to someone somewhere, they would not exist.

Finally while the assessment presents a dichotomy (pain vs. joy) it is meant as a tool to keep us from fence-sitting; the line is not hard and the scale is long.

## Joy

- Helpful, complete, and minimal documenation: TailwindCSS, Sass, 
- Utility classes for rapid development and styling before committing to a definition: TailWindCSS, USWDS,
- CSS-first philosophy: Sass
- Reduce duplication and file size for users - with minimal effort and scraping.

## Pain

- The market in general seems kind of settled; many UI libraries that were "up and coming" now seem to have gone stail - if we don't want to use it, it's really not worth making a product out of it *and* depending on someone else to be around in the next 2 or 3 years is touch or go: Semantic UI, Scut, 
- Utility classes as anything beyond a means to a new means.
- Configuration (subtractive) over extension/convention (additive): TailWindCSS, BootStrap, Foundation
- Without customization sites risk looking and feeling the same; saw this particularly around 2015 as rapid prototyping was done a lot using Bootstrap.
